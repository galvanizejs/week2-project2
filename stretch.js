// Strech Goals

// HEDS ER TALES?
// 1. Use the following variable for your coin flip action:
       var coin = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);
//     We're using Math.random again, along with Math.floor.
//     Remember, Math.random gives you a random number between 0 and 1.
//     Calling Math.floor on that number will truncate the decimal, and give you a
//     random number within the bounds of your array. (In this case, our array will only contain two items.)
// 2. Use a while loop to keep flipping the coin until you get tails.

// 3. FIZZ BUZZ
// Write a program that uses console.log to print each number up to 100, with a couple exceptions...
// If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
// If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
// If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.


// CHESS BOARD
// 4. Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines.
// At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board.

//Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

//  # # # #
// # # # #
//  # # # #
// # # # #
//  # # # #
// # # # #
//  # # # #
// # # # #

// When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and change the program
// so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
